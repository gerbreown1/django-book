# Preface

This book is about creating applications for the web and the desktop using the web framework called Django. 

## Reason for this book.
When I was in my 10th grade Physics class the teacher was always saying: "The best way to learn a subject is to teach it."  

I am in the process of learning how to create applications in Django so to help me learn it I decided to create this tutorial book.

## My development system:
 * HP All-in-one desktop system 64 bit.
 * Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.
 * Geany text editor.
 * GIT version control.
 * MySQL/MariaDB database.
 
## The sample application that we will be building as we go through this book.

It will be a word counting application that can be used by writers to count the number of words that they create on their projects.
