# Requirements Documents.

## Why this chapter?
As a software engineer I have attended many conferences and training seminars. One thing that is stressed that for each and every project the first step is to define the requirements.

I have a large number of books on programming using various languages and frame works. None of these books even mention this requirement to create requirement documents.

This should apply to any and all projects, not just software.  Take building a house for example. To make sure that it is structurally sound you will need a blueprint (a type of requirement) 

## What are the requirements?
The requirements are statements that you need to specify in order to know what the application is going to do.

## Why do you need requirements?
An old saying: "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail."  This is why you need the requirements so that you do not fail with your projects.

As I am creating this book in concert with the *word-count* application I have decided to create 2 additional chapters. One will be for the application and the other one for this book.
