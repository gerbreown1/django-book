# Preface

This book is about creating applications for the web and the desktop using the web framework called Django. 

## Reason for this book.
When I was in my 10th grade Physics class the teacher was always saying: "The best way to learn a subject is to teach it."

I am in the process of learning how to create applications in Django so to help me learn it I decided to create this tutorial book to help in my learning process. On that note, if you find any errors I would appreciate it if you could let me know at: feedback@gerbreown.com.

The Geany text editor that I am using has a word count feature but it only show the count for the current file and not the whole book.  LibreOffice Writer does show the word count but its file is not compatible with the Markdown text formatter.

## My development system:
 * HP All-in-one desktop system 64 bit.
 * Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.
 * Geany text editor.
 * GIT version control.
 * MySQL/MariaDB database.
 
## The sample application that we will be building as we go through this book.

This application will **NOT** be a *hello world* make believe application.

It will be a word counting application that can be used by writers to count the number of words that they create on their projects.
