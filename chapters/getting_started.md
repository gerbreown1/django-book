# Getting started.

## Make sure that you have Python installed on your system as Django is programmed in this language.
To verify that you have Python installed just enter _python_ at the command prompt.  If it is installed it will provide you with information about the version etc.  If it is not installed then it will not show you anything and that you will need to install it first before you can use Django.

### Getting Python installed.

It can be down loaded from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Getting Django installed.

There are at least 3 ways to get Django installed on your system.

1. If using Ubuntu just enter _sudo apt-get install python-django_.  One problem with this is that you might not get the latest version.
1. Enter _pip install django-x.x.x_ where 'x.x.x' is the latest version.  This is the route that I took.
1. Download the [source code](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) and then compile it.  An [installation guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/install/) is available if you require help.
